This project explores maternal and infant health outcomes, focusing on predicting low birth weight (LBW) and eclampsia. 
We use machine learning classification models to analyze large-scale natality datasets combined with air quality data.

## Goals
- Predict low birth weight and eclampsia using U.S. natality data
- Minimize false negatives in predicting adverse health outcomes
- Investigate the impact of air quality on low birth weight and eclampsia predictions

## Data Sources
- [National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Natality Birth Data – NBER](https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data)
- [EPA Outdoor Air Quality Data](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)
